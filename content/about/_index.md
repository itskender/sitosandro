**IT, 1987**  \
Born in Rome. He is a photographer, assistant curator, and writer. 
His major focus is the public space and its different spatial typologies, exploring the human presence within the urban environment and how individuals navigate and interact with the surroundings. \
His practice draws on the languages of documentary photography and his most recents works examine the themes of memory, family archives, and language as a binding force within communities.

He collaborated with several photographers, artists and Institutions including [Alessandro Imbriaco](http://www.alessandroimbriaco.com/news.html), [Giorgio Di Noto](http://www.giorgiodinoto.com), [ICCD](http://iccd.beniculturali.it) and [Leporello](https://leporello-books.com/) bookshop, gaining valuable experience and expanding his artistic horizons. \
He worked as studio manager and assistant curator for Magnum Photos photographer [Paolo Pellegrin](https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/paolo-pellegrin/) for 3 years.

He is currently living and working in Rome as a freelance photographer.
