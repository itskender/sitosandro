_Terra ferma, casa amada_ takes on the issue of Catalan identity and its relationship with the language. What does it mean to be Catalan? Who are the Catalans today? What is the value of Catalan in the construction of their identity and in the concept of community? \
The project sees language as an identity and cultural medium, a place to return to when you are away. The result is that Catalan identity exists and blooms wherever its language endures, suggesting that Catalonia cannot survive without the Catalan language. 

Photography helps provide a new reading of the current situation, putting together a scattered and changing community like the Catalan one
