_Onze_ explores the complex relationship between Catalan identity and its language. What does it mean to be Catalan today? Who are the Catalans in a modern and evolving world? How does the Catalan language shape their sense of identity and community? \
The project sees language as both an anchor of identity and a vessel of culture - a home one can return to, even when physically distant. The result is that Catalan identity exists and blooms wherever its language endures,  emphasizing that the survival of Catalonia is intrinsically tied to the endurance of its linguistic heritage.

Photography helps provide a new reading of the current situation, weaving together a scattered and ever-changing community like the Catalan one .
