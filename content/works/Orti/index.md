_A century after the establishment of commemorative monuments and parks built in Italy in the aftermath of the First World War to honour the fallen, a project initiated by the [ICCD](http://iccd.beniculturali.it) in Rome raises questions around the theme of the monument and memory by proposing a selection of contemporary works. These are the result of heterogeneous projects ranging from documentary photography to illustration._ 

The **War Garden** is a herbarium consisting of vegetables and fruits grown in war gardens at the time of the First World War.
The practice spread throughout Italy from 1917, thanks to textbooks in which practical advice were given on how to grow a vegetable garden to satisfy a family's nutritional needs. The study of war gardens aims at showing how this practice is still valuable today, fostering important issues such as the attention to the environment, and, above all, social relationships.
