The Habitable Exoplanets Catalog **(HEC)** is an online database of potentially habitable worlds discoveries for scientists, educators, and the general public. A potentially habitable exoplanet implies a planet outside our solar system with conditions roughly comparable to those of Earth and thus potentially favourable to earth-like life.

Japan, so fascinating and yet sometimes so unexplicable for us, takes on a new perspective: an exoplanet in which life has taken a different turn, but still similar to our.
