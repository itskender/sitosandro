_Marine snow_ refers to a continuous rain of organic and inorganic particles that falls from the upper layers of the water column. The particles that constitute marine snow are so called because of the way they appear, flakes that fall in the darkness of the deep sea.

This work is a collection of photographs from 2018 to 2023, from my personal archive of travels, assignments, private moments, friends and strangers. It covers the period from the death of my father in 2018 to the death of my mother at the end of 2023. The archive is a glimpse of how I navigated through that time. _Marine Snow: is not, however, a project about grief, but rather a reflection on the notion of memory and the ways in which photography can interfere with it.

As Joan Didion wrote “Time passes, memory fades, memory adjusts, memory conforms to what we think we remember.” 
But more than anything, memory is built, constructed upon the personal, familial, and environmental changes that we witness.
