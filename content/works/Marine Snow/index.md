_Marine snow_ is a collection of photographs taken in recent years. The photos are autonomous, with no direct reference to what is happening outside of them, and do not intend to tell a story.
Like marine snowflakes, the photos are descending towards the bottom, each with its own gravity and weight.
Without a beginning nor an end, these images provide a narrative structure that does not reside in the individual frame.
The meaning in the images comes together with time, as layer adds upon layer.

As Joan Didion wrote “Time passes, memory fades, memory adjusts, memory conforms to what we think we remember.” 
But more than anything, memory is built, constructed upon the personal, familial, and environmental changes that we witness.
